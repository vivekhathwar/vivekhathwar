## **Vivek V Hathwar here...**
### Let me tell you the story of how I became a software engineer:

  Not so long ago in 2014 I completed my SSLC (10th) with a staggering 97%. Seeing this few relatives and friends suggested taking up science stream. So, I took a science stream combination of PCMS (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Statistics).
I got 96%. And, there was a buzz going on saying computer science is the deal and, engineering is the best. Influenced by the trend I ended up choosing engineering in a prestigious college.
   
  That's when I realised I f*cked up. I don't know what coding is. Forget computers, I can't understand humans. Plus the idea of coding is pretty new. The marks started falling.
So, I threw the marks down and started experimenting. Thanks to the bookworm in me and statistics I studied in PU, I was able to grasp some basics. Started applying them in Hackathons and all. 

  :speaking_head: So you can ask me about **Basic OOPS, OOADP and Data Structures** _( :shushing_face: -- Don't tell anyone that I'm no expert.)_

  I was just becoming confident **BOOOM** I had already graduated :man_student: from **[Ramaiah Institute of Technology](http://msrit.edu)** with BE(ISE). 
By then I was already placed in campus recruitment.

And, hence this is my current profile.
